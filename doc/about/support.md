## Who supports mybinder.org?

- [The mybinder.org landing page](https://mybinder.org) has list of organizations that financially support mybinder.org.
- {external+tc:doc}`team` has a list of personnel that support the project.

## Our major costs

In addition to developing and maintaining the many open source tools built by this project, we also have a few extra costs:

- **Cloud expenses for mybinder.org**: The service at mybinder.org serves tens of thousands of sessions each week, each of which run in the cloud.
  We pay for this infrastructure via donations of credits and money from the community.
- **Personnel to operate mybinder.org**: Running a heavily-used and complex cloud service requires expertise in cloud infrastructure development and operation.
  We receive in-kind contributions from several individuals and organizations to help us sustain these operations.

## Help with our open source efforts

Finally, all of the techology behind mybinder.org is built by an open community.
We welcome any kind of contributions and support.
You can find many ways to contribute to the Binder community, codebase, and services at [](./contribute.md).

## Attribution for team members

We wish to recognize the contributions that individuals and organizations make on behalf of Binder.
For this reason, we define a few key contribution areas below, and explicitly recognize these contributions in our mybinder.org pages.

- *mybinder.org federation members* - Institutions that deploy, fund, and staff their own BinderHub in the federation.
- *mybinder.org partner institutions* - Institutions that employ individuals that operate any hubs in the mybinder.org federation (if not full federation members).
- *mybinder.org major supporters* - Institutions that provide significant financial resources or credits for any hubs in the mybinder.org federation ("significant" is defined as anything greater than $10,000 annually).
