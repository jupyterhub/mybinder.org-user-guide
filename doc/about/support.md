## Our major costs

In addition to developing and maintaining the many open source tools built by this project, we also have a few extra costs:

- **Cloud expenses for mybinder.org**: The service at mybinder.org serves tens of thousands of sessions each week, each of which run in the cloud.
  We pay for this infrastructure via donations of credits and money from the community.
- **Personnel to operate mybinder.org**: Running a heavily-used and complex cloud service requires expertise in cloud infrastructure development and operation.
  We receive in-kind contributions from several individuals and organizations to help us sustain these operations.
