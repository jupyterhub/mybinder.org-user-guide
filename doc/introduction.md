# Get started with Binder

This page will help you get started building your own repositories and sharing them with Binder. For more information about the Binder Project in general, see [](../about/index).

## What is a Binder?

A Binder (also called a Binder-ready repository) is a code repository that
contains at least two things:

1. **Code or content that you'd like people to run.** This might be a
   Jupyter Notebook that explains an idea, or an R script that makes a
   visualization.
2. **Configuration files for your environment.** These files are used
   by Binder to build the environment needed to run your code.
   For a list of all configuration files available, see the
   [](config-files) page.

Configuration files may be placed in the root of
your repository or in a `binder/` folder in the repository's root
(i.e. `myproject/binder/`).

A Binder repository can be built by a BinderHub, which will generate a
link that you can share with others, allowing them to interact with the
content in your repository.


## What is `mybinder.org`?

`mybinder.org` is an online service for building and sharing reproducible and interactive
computational environments from online repositories. Under the hood, it is a
federation of BinderHub deployments that are maintained by the
Binder community. It serves as both a public service and a demonstration
of the BinderHub technology, though it is by no means the only BinderHub
in existence. If you're interested in deploying your own BinderHub for your
own uses, please see the [BinderHub documentation][BinderHub]
and don't hesitate to reach out to the [Binder community](https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/binder).

## What is the Binder community?

A collection of people that aim to make it easy to turn
computational material (e.g. Jupyter notebooks, R scripts, and environment
files) into computational environments (a Docker image) and serve this
environment through the cloud. The underlying technology that manages this
process is called [BinderHub][BinderHub].

For more information, check out :ref:`about`.

## What is BinderHub?

[BinderHub][BinderHub] is the server technology that
turns computational material into
interactive computational environments in the cloud. It utilizes
[Kubernetes and JupyterHub](https://z2jh.jupyter.org) in order to
simplify the deployment process and make it easy to scale.

(preparing_repositories)=

## How can I prepare a repository for Binder?

To prepare your repository for use with the BinderHub at mybinder.org, you should ensure that the following conditions are met:

* The repository is in a public location online (e.g., on GitHub or BitBucket)
* The repository does not require any personal or sensitive information
  (such as passwords)
* The repository has configuration files that specify its environment
  (see below for an example)
* The repository contains content designed for people to read.

:::{tip}
For a list of sample repositories for use with Binder, see the
[Sample Binder Repositories](examples/sample_repos) page.
:::

## How can I customize my Binder environment?

There are many ways to customize the Binder environment.
For example, you can [use many open source languages](howto/languages.rst), [configure the user interface](howto/user_interface.rst), and more!

For more information, check out [the How-to guides](../howto/index.md) or [the sample repository examples](../examples/index.md).

## A Binder example

For example, let's take a look at a simple repository that requires a
few packages in order to run.

### Explore the repository contents

If we inspect the contents of this repository,
we see the following files:

```bash
./
├── environment.yml
├── index.ipynb
└── README.md
```

In this case, we have two important files:

* **A content file**: `index.ipynb` is a short Jupyter Notebook that
  generates a plot.
* **An environment configuration file**: `environment.yml` is a standard
  file that specifies an Anaconda environment.


:::{important}
You may notice that `environment.yml` is not Binder-specific. This is
intentional! Binder tries to use environment configuration files that are
already standards in the data science community. For a list of all
configuration files available, see the [](config-files) page.
:::

### Get your own copy of this repository

You can find a repository with these files at the following link:

<https://github.com/binder-examples/conda>

To watch Binder in action, first **fork this repository**. This will
give you your own copy of the `conda` repository.

### Build your repository

Next, let's **build your Binder repository**. Head to <https://mybinder.org>.
You'll see a form that asks you to specify a repository for mybinder.org to
build. In the first field, paste the URL of your forked repository. It'll look
something like this:

```
https://github.com/<your-username>/conda
```

Finally, click the **launch** button. This will ask mybinder.org to
build the environment needed to run the repository. You can click on the
"Build logs" button to see the logs generated by the build process.

While your Binder repository is building, note the URL that points to your unique Binder.
You can share this URL with a friend, allowing them to access an interactive
version of your repository.

See below for a quick layout of the BinderHub user interface.

![The myinder.org UI](_static/images/mybinder-ui-start.png)

If your Binder repository has already been built once, then subsequent clicks on
the Binder link will not re-trigger the build process. However, if you
push any changes to the repository, then it will be re-built the next time
somebody clicks a link.

If your environment files and content files are not housed in the same branch of the same repository, see the [](external_binder_setup) page for how to generate a URL.

Now that you're acquainted with Binder, see the [](using-binder) page
for more information about what you can do with it.
