**Binder** allows you to create custom computing environments that can be shared
and used by many remote users. This page provides information for those who
wish to use a pre-existing Binder deployment (e.g., ``mybinder.org``).

If you'd like to create and administer your own Binder deployment, see the
`BinderHub documentation <http://binderhub.readthedocs.io>`_. The BinderHub
documentation guides you through creating a cluster, deploying BinderHub, and
administering a BinderHub deployment.

See the `Binder Examples <https://github.com/binder-examples>`_ GitHub
organization for sample Binder repositories demonstrating its functionality.

.. note::

   Binder is a research pilot, whose main goal is to understand usage patterns
   and workloads for future evolution and development. It is not a service that
   can be relied on for critical operations.
